Data upload and analyzed on KITT.
## Using Terminal
### 1. Set-Up (downloading software programs, creating folders, and uploading raw data)

**Downloading Bioconda (skip this step if Bioconda has already been downloaded).**

```
# downloading Miniconda software
$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# restarting window with source command
$ source ~/.bashrc

# adding different channels
$ conda config --add channels defaults
	# should get: "warning: 'defaults' already in 'channels' list, moving to the top"
$ conda config --add channels bioconda
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge

# to see if this worked with cat command
$ cat .condarc
```

> Bioconda is a bioinformatics software package manager. See more at [https://bioconda.github.io](https:///bioconda.github.io).

**Create and activate an environment in conda**  

```
$ conda create -n Final_Project
$ conda activate Final_Project
```

**Creating and entering a directory for this project** 

```
$ mkdir Final_Project # creates a directory
$ cd Final_Project # navigates into this new directory
```

**Copying raw data files to directory on KITT**

```
$ scp -p XXXX /home/emmastrand/MyProjects/EpiRAD-RAD_Geoduck2016/Raw_Data/* .
# XXXX above indicates the password specific for our lab's KITT.
# scp = secure copy 
```

### 2. Checking Quality of Raw Data

**Double check the files downloaded correctly using checksum**

```
$ md5sum *.fastq.gz > kitt_checksums.md5 # the checksums for the data files downloaded on kitt
$ cksum checksums.md5 kitt_checksums.md5 # comparing the checksums 
$ md5sum -c kitt_checksums.md5
$ md5sum -c checksums.md5 
```
> Calculating a md5sum is a way of checking file integrity. In other words, confirming that two files contain the same information and that data wasn't lost in the downloading process.

**Combining split files??**  
Double check with HP to see if R1 and R2 need to be combined.

### 3. Demultiplexing Data Files

**Separating species?**

**Converting files to .fq.gz format for dDocent.**

### 4. Quality Filtering, *De Novo* Assembly, Read Mapping, SNP Calling, and SNP Filtering

**Installing and starting dDocent** 

```
$ conda install dDocent # you only need to do this once. skip if already downloaded.
$ dDocent
```

> dDocent is a bioinformatics program created by [Dr. Jon Purtiz](https://github.com/jpuritz) that is specifically designed for different types of RAD sequencing.
