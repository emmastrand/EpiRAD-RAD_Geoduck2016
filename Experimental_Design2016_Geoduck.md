# 2016 Larval Geoduck Experimental Design 
This experiment was conducted by a research team led by [Dr. Hollie Putnam](https://github.com/hputnam) and [Dr. Steven Roberts](https://github.com/sr320) at the University of Washington in 2016. A preliminary summary of Trial 2 can be found here: [Trial 2](https://safsoa.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/trial-2-preliminary-summary/). 


About 7 million geoduck larvae were exposed to acute pH stress with 2 treatments: ambient (7.9) and low (7.41) pH for 6 days. On the 7th day, the larvae from the low pH treatment were separated into two experimental conditions: low (7.41) and extreme low (7.00) pH for three days. Survivorship was tracked through the 10 days and molecular timepoints were taken at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10 days. Molecular samples were stored in RNAlater and at -80Â°C.

After 4 days of treatment, ciliate presence in the ambient condition was associated with mass mortality. On Day 6, the remaining larvae were split into either the same treatment (pH 7.41) or an even higher pCO<sub>2</sub> conditions (pH 7.00). Survival rates were for Days 0-6 and Days 6-10 were higher in the 7.41 pH level.
