Project summary, experimental design, raw data, annotated bioinformatic pipeline notes, and final data analysis can be found in this repository. 

In an experiment in 2016, about 7 million geoduck larvae were exposed to several levels of pH treatments to simulate predicted ocean acidification conditions in the Pacific Northwest. Survivorship was tracked and samples were taken for later molecular analysis using EpiRADseq and RADseq.
